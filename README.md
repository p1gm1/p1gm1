#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

Currently working with DroneSky as a Machine Learning engineer setting several app's of computer vision 
to assist in presicion agriculture of coffee crops in Colombia. Also working on the following
open source projects:

* Sky-eye, a desktop and web app for counting crops of oil-palm, guava and passion-fruit.
* Thermoapp, a web app to organize termographic photos and printing it's reports online.
